# AkzelBot

## Intro

Introducing AkzelBot, my custom Twitch chat bot. The primary purpose of this bot is mostly as a learning tool for myself, rather than a program intended for the masses. However, that doesn't mean it's unusable; I do use it whenever I stream, and it does the job just fine.

As it is now, AkzelBot lacks any sort of moderation functionality; it primarily serves to relay specific messages (such as social media links), or randomly pulling from a list of puns and quotes (stored in `lists.json`) to send one to chat. As I grow as a developer, I do intend to expand AkzelBot's functionality. I don't have any specific plans at the moment, but I'm open to suggestions.

Rewrite in progress.
